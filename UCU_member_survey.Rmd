As mandated by members during our last Extraordinary General Meeting, the UEA UCU Committee has created a brief, anonymous survey to collate member experiences and feedback and ensure this informs our ongoing discussions with management. 

This survey currently has **`r nrow(dd)` responses** with the last addition at **`r last(dd$Timestamp)`**. 

This script was last run on **`r lubridate::as_datetime(today())`**.

## Question 1 - What department are you based in?

```{r q1}
bartwo <- mybar(dd,30, ordered = FALSE, colbyrisk=FALSE, perc=FALSE)
bartwo+scale_x_discrete(guide=guide_axis(n.dodge=2))
```

## Question 2 - Would you class yourself, or those in your household, as moderate risk or high risk from COVID-19?

```{r q2}
mybar(dd,3, ordered = TRUE, colbyrisk=F)

```

## Question 5 - Have you undertaken any face-to-face learning activities so far this term?

```{r q5}
mybar(dd,6, ordered = TRUE)
```



## Question 7 - How satisfied are you with the training and support available to staff to aid "blended" or fully online learning approaches?

```{r q7}
mybar(dd,8)
```


## Questions 9:13 - How strongly do you agree with the following statements?

```{r q9 to 13,fig.height = 20}
dd %>%
  select(10:14) %>%
  mutate(myfill = ifelse(grepl("low risk",pull(dd, 3)),"Low risk", "High risk")) %>%
  mutate(myfill = factor(myfill,levels = c("Low risk","High risk"))) %>%
  gather(key = key, value = value, -myfill) %>%
  mutate(cq = value) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(cq))) %>%
  mutate(key = str_remove(key,"How strongly do you agree with the following statements")) %>%
  mutate(key = str_remove_all(key,"\\[|\\]|\\?")) %>%
  mutate(cq = str_wrap(cq,width = 15),
         key = str_wrap(key,width = 50)) %>%
  mutate(cq = factor(cq,levels = c("Strongly Disagree","Disagree","Neither Agree nor\nDisagree","Agree","Strongly Agree"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cq, fill = myfill)) +
  geom_bar()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0,
                                   hjust=0.5,vjust=0.5))+
  ylab("Count")+
  xlab("")+
  facet_wrap(~key,ncol = 2, scale="free_y")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(1, 0), 
        legend.justification = c(3, -3)
  )+

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple4","hotpink1"))+
  guides(myfill=guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=5)))




```

##  Questions 14 -  Which of the following statements match your feelings about face-to-face learning activities? (Tick all that apply)

```{r q14}
answers <- c("I feel my concerns are heard locally, but ignored by Faculty and/or University management",
             "I don't have any concerns about face-to-face learning activities",
             "I feel my concerns have been totally ignored",
             "I don't know how to effectively voice my concerns",
             "I feel my concerns are heard and appropriate actions are taken",
             "I feel my concerns are heard, but nothing is done as a result")

d1 <- filter(dd,grepl("low risk",pull(dd, 3)))
d2 <- filter(dd,!grepl("low risk",pull(dd, 3)))

t1 <- tibble(answers,
             count = map_int(answers, ~sum(grepl(.,pull(d1,15)))),
             myfill = "Low risk") %>%
  mutate(answers = str_wrap(answers,width = 15))
t2 <- tibble(answers,
             count = map_int(answers, ~sum(grepl(.,pull(d2,15)))),
             myfill = "High risk") %>%
  mutate(answers = str_wrap(answers,width = 15))

temp <- bind_rows(t1,t2)
temp$answers <- factor(temp$answers,levels = t2$answers[order(t1$count, decreasing = T)])
    temp$myfill <- factor(temp$myfill,levels = c("Low risk","High risk"))

    ggplot(temp, aes(x = answers,fill = myfill, y = count)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0,
                                       hjust=0.95,vjust=0.5),
            legend.title = element_blank()) +
      ylab("Count")+
      xlab("")+
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple4","hotpink1"))
```


## Comments

#### N.B. responses have been shared only when permission was granted to do so

```{r q24}
dd %>% filter(!is.na(.[[25]]),
              .[[29]] == "Yes, you may cite my written responses to the open questions in this survey") %>%
  select(" " = 25) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```


## Simple stats tests

A simple ANOVA of self-declared risk level to COVID-19 as a predictor of responses to the question 
"How satisfied are you with the resumption of face-to-face learning activities?"

```{r}
dd[[3]] <- factor(dd[[3]], levels=names(table(dd[[3]])[order(table(dd[[3]]), decreasing=T)]))
m=lm(dd[[7]]~dd[[3]])

kable((anova(m)), digits=2)
```
