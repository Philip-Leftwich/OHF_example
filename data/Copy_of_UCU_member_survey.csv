Teaching Unions have been working tirelessly to ensure that they can support their students while maintaining safely, and I'd like to think that UCU could do the same instead of posturing. But similarly, the announcement that we'll expand f2f contact from week 6 is mad, both as it doesn't take into account the spread of the virus, and as it creates a vast amount of timetabling workload for administrative staff who are already behind and overwhelmed and hugely slowed by working remotely.
If there is one thing that could be done now, it would be to push the university to expand its asymptomatic testing. I had mine done on the first day of term, and it turns out I can't have another until further notice. We need people being regularly tested rather than a one-off on the first day of term, if we're actually going to monitor and check the spread of the virus.","Yes, you may cite my written responses to the open questions in this survey"
